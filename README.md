## Run the project locally with Devcontainers

This repository supports the VS Code dev containers feature, which allows you to create a consistent and isolated development environment inside a Docker container. To use this feature, you need to have the following pre requisites:

- VS Code
- Docker installed on your system
- [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for VS Code

Once you have these installed, you can open the repository in VS Code and follow these steps:

- Press F1 and select the Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container... command.
- Select the repository folder and wait for the container to build and start.
- You can now edit, run, debug, and test your code inside the container.

For more information on how to use VS Code dev containers, please refer to the official documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, it requires [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

### Install Python

Check if you already have Python installed by running the following command.

```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.0
```

If you receive a response similar to the one shown above, `Python 3.8.0` is your default Python version.

If you don't seem to have `Python` installed, grab the latest release from the [official downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install pip

pip is already installed if you are using Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from [python.org][python-org] or if you are working in a [Virtual Environment][virtual-env-guide] created by [virtualenv][virtualenv] or [pyvenv][pyenv]. Just make sure to [upgrade pip][pip-upgrade-guide].
