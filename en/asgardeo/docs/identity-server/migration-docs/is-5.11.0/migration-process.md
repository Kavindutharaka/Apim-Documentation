# Migration Process

This section contains the complete migration process related to the WSO2 Identity Server.
Go through the guidelines given below before attempting to migrate the production environment.

## Recommendations

1. If you already have a [WSO2 subscription](https://wso2.com/subscription), reach out to our support team through your [support account](https://support.wso2.com/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa).

2. Always migrate to the [latest version](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management) since the latest fixes and new features are available in the most recent version. If you have a particular requirement to migrate to an intermediate version, contact [WSO2 Support](https://support.wso2.com/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa).

> **Note**
>
> Migrating the production environment requires additional hardware/VM resources since both the old and new environments will run until all the traffic is routed to the new environment.

## Do you have a custom requirement?

If your customizations are already available in the latest version, you can remove the customization after migration. You can contact [WSO2 Support](https://support.wso2.com/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa) for assistance.
However, if a custom requirement is unavailable in the latest version, follow the steps below to migrate the customizations.

- First, update the dependency version of the dependent WSO2 components and re-build the customized component.
- As a practice, WSO2 does not make API changes in minor releases of the dependency jars. However, update the custom code and rebuild if there are API changes.
- For more information about migrating customizations, see the section on **Migrating Custom Components**.

## Step-by-step instructions

Follow the steps given below once you have followed the steps above to migrate customizations **OR** if you do not have any custom requirements.

1. List down the functional and non-functional use cases in your deployment and create test cases for them.

    > **Important**
    >
    > This step is crucial to verify that the migrated environment works as expected.

2. Make sure that all the properties in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file, such as the database configurations, are set to the correct values based on the requirement.

3. Identify the configuration migrations required for the new setup. For more information, see the document on **What Has Changed in IS 5.11.0**.

4. Prepare a test setup of the migrating version with customizations and necessary config changes, and test your functional and non-functional requirements.

5. Before starting the migration, run the [token and session cleanup scripts](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/5.11.0/setup/removing-unused-tokens-from-the-database#using-stored-procedures-for-token-cleanup) in the databases of the environment if you are not doing regular cleanups.

    > **Info**
    >
    > Clean-up scripts can be found in the relevant db folder in `<IS-HOME>/dbscripts/identity/stored-procedures`

6. Start the migration from the lowest environment such as dev and continue up to the highest before the production such as pre-prod.

7. Run the test cases in the migrated environments to confirm that your functional and nonfunctional requirements are met in the migrated environment.

8. Prior to the production migration, run a pilot migration on your pre-prod environment. It will be ideal if the pre-prod environment is similar to the production environment.
    + If possible, restore a database dump of the production environment to the pre-prod environment and perform the pilot migration.
    + If the production database dump cannot be used, at least ensure that you have sufficient data in the database to mimic the production environment.

> **Recommendation**
>
> When you follow the above steps, you can get a rough estimate of the time for the final production update and allocate time slots per the above analysis. WSO2 recommends performing the migration while the system is under minimum traffic.

Once you are satisfied with the above steps, proceed with production migration. After the migration is complete, verify it using the following steps.

+ Monitor the system's health (CPU, memory usage, etc.).
+ Monitor the WSO2 logs for errors.

> **Note**
>
> If you see any problems in the migrated system, revert the traffic to the previous setup and investigate the problem.
