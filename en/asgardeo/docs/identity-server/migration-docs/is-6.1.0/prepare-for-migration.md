# Preparing for migration

Before you start the migration, see the instructions given here.

> **Note**
>
> In this section, `<OLD_IS_HOME>` is the directory where the current WSO2 Identity Server resides in, and `<NEW_IS_HOME>` is the directory where WSO2 Identity Server 6.1.0 resides in.

## Prerequisites

1. Review what has changed in this release. For a detailed list of changes from WSO2 IS version 6.0.0 to 6.1.0, see the document on **What Has Changed in WSO2 IS 6.1.0**.

2. Before you migrate, refer to the **Migration Process** document to get an understanding of the migration process.

3. You can use the [Update Management Tool](https://updates.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/) (UMT) to get any fixes or latest updates for this release.

4. Take a backup of the existing database used by the current WSO2 Identity Server. This backup is necessary in case the migration causes any issues in the existing database.

6. Before proceeding with the migration, change the following property to `false` in the `<NEW_IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

    ```toml
    [super_admin]
    create_admin_account = false 
    ```

> **Note**
>
> - If you are migrating from a version below IS 5.9.0 with a **JDBC primary userstore** configured, use the following configuration to disable the use of **Unique ID Userstore Managers** during the migration.
>
>    ```toml
>    [user_store]
>    type = "database"
>    ```
>
>   As the former (non-unique ID) userstore managers are no longer supported, this configuration **must** be changed to the Unique ID Userstore Manager after the migration is complete to ensure proper functionality in IS 6.1.0 by using the configuration below.
>
>   ```toml
>   [user_store]
>   type = "database_unique_id"
>   ```
>
> - If you are migrating from a version below IS 5.10.0, disable the Groups and Roles Separation feature during the migration.
>
>    ```toml
>    [authorization_manager.properties]
>    GroupAndRoleSeparationEnabled = false
>    ```
>   After the migration is complete, change this configuration to enable the feature.
>
> - It is recommended to run the [token cleanup scripts](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/6.1.0/deploy/remove-unused-tokens-from-the-database) before migration to clean the expired, inactive, and revoked tokens/codes. This reduces the time taken for migration.

## Prepare for Groups and Roles separation

With WSO2 Identity Server 5.11.0, groups and roles are separated. For more information, see the document on **What Has Changed in 5.11.0**.

However, you may or may not have opted not to use the new groups and roles feature in your WSO2 IS 5.11.0 deployment. When you migrate from WSO2 IS 5.11.0 to WSO2 IS 6.1.0, you can choose whether to continue with the old functionality or to switch to the new groups and roles functionality.

> **Backward compatibility**
>
> Groups and role separation improvements bring enhanced clarity, and improved performance to the product. All of these improvements and behavioral changes are introduced in a way that existing deployments can adapt to the new state as easily as possible.
>
> However, itâ€™s inevitable to bring all the goodness with zero compromises. Therefore, if you opt to use this, some applications, customizations, and integration flows might need some changes to fully adapt to these improvements. Alternatively, you can choose to disable this functionality in WSO2 IS 6.1.0 and continue to use the old way of working.

* wso2.roles claim = http://wso2.org/claims/roles
* wso2.groups claim = http://wso2.org/claims/groups

### Enable Groups and Roles separation

If you want to use the new groups and roles functionality in WSO2 IS 6.1.0, consider the following recommendations.

> **Note**
> 
> * All claim configurations are already configured OOTB in the fresh pack and will be done via the migration client for migrating deployments. No need to configure these manually.
> * Any custom external claim mapped to the wso2.role claim should be mapped to either wso2.roles or wso2.groups claim as per the requirement of the custom use case.
> * Our recommendation is to fix any consuming client to become compatible with these changes. But if somehow the above configs need to be reverted (possibly in a migrated deployment), it can be done via the Identity Server [Claim Management REST APIs](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/6.1.0/apis/claim-management-rest-api/).
  
-   **Utilizing carbon kernel level support**

    The following abstract userstore manager APIs: `getUserClaimValues()`, `getUsersClaimValues()`, 
    `getUserClaimValuesWithID()`, `getUsersClaimValuesWithID()` now support both ```wso2.roles``` and ```wso2.groups``` claims properly. We recommend modifying custom extensions to request wso2.roles or wso2.groups via the above APIs rather depending on wso2.role claim.

-   **Service provider role mapping and identity provider role mapping restrictions**

     We recommend removing existing SP and IdP role mappings that use groups, and utilize roles to achieve the same functionality.

-   **OIDC group claim return groups**

     OIDC group claim does not return internal roles anymore. We recommend modifying applications and custom extensions to utilize this behavior. If roles are required, use the OIDC roles claim.

-   **Obtaining roles via the SAML assertion**

     We recommend applications and custom extensions to switch from wso2.role to the wso2.roles claim in the SAML assertion.

-   **SCIM2 roles.default claim returns roles and groups claim return groups**

     Previously, the ```roles.default``` claim in SCIM2 returned both groups and roles as it was mapped to the wso2.roles claim. It is now mapped to the ```wso2.roles``` claim, where only roles are returned. In order to get groups, `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:groups` claim should be used instead since, with this improvement, it is returning groups as intended.

-   **Groups and roles in SCIM2 user response**

     Previously users and roles in the SCIM2 user response returned as a single comma-separated entity. However, that has changed, and now they return as separate complex entities. We recommend modifying clients that consume this response.

### Disable Groups and Roles separation

If it's mandatory to preserve previous behavior and avoid enabling the improvements mentioned above, follow the steps given below.

1.  Add the following configuration (enabled by default) to the `<IS-Home>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

    ```java
    [authorization_manager.properties]
    group_and_role_separation_improvements_enabled = false
    ```

    > **Note**
    >
    > But this configuration option only ensures that the code-level logic is reverted to the previous behavior. If the improvements are already applied (fresh IS server pack and a migrated pack with group-role migration step completed), these claim configuration changes need to be reverted manually in both tenants and the super-tenant prior to setting the above config to false. To do this, refer to the claim changes introduced with this effort and revert them manually or via a script.

2.  To stop claim data migration related to the groups vs roles improvement during the migration, open the `claim-config.xml` file in the `<IS-HOME>/migration-resources/6.0.0/data/6/` directory and remove the following claims that are related to groups and roles.

    - In `http://wso2.org/claims` dialect:

        ```
        <Claim>
            <ClaimURI>http://wso2.org/claims/roles</ClaimURI>
            <DisplayName>Roles</DisplayName>
            <AttributeID>roles</AttributeID>
            <Description>Roles</Description>
            <SupportedByDefault/>
            <ReadOnly />
        </Claim>
        <Claim>
            <ClaimURI>http://wso2.org/claims/groups</ClaimURI>
            <DisplayName>Groups</DisplayName>
            <AttributeID>groups</AttributeID>
            <Description>Groups</Description>
            <SupportedByDefault />
            <ReadOnly />
        </Claim>
        <Claim>
            <ClaimURI>http://wso2.org/claims/role</ClaimURI>
            <DisplayName>Roles and groups</DisplayName>
            <AttributeID>role</AttributeID>
            <Description>Include both userstore groups and internal roles</Description>
            <ReadOnly />
        </Claim>
        ```

    - In `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User` dialect:

        ```
        <Claim>
            <ClaimURI>urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:roles.default</ClaimURI>
            <DisplayName>Roles</DisplayName>
            <AttributeID>roles</AttributeID>
            <Description>Roles</Description>
            <DisplayOrder>5</DisplayOrder>
            <SupportedByDefault />
            <MappedLocalClaim>http://wso2.org/claims/roles</MappedLocalClaim>
        </Claim>
        ```

    - In `http://wso2.org/oidc/claim` dialect:

        ```
        <Claim>
            <ClaimURI>groups</ClaimURI>
            <DisplayName>User Groups</DisplayName>
            <AttributeID>role</AttributeID>
            <Description>List of group names that have been assigned to the principal. This typically will require a mapping at the application container level to application deployment roles.</Description>
            <DisplayOrder>12</DisplayOrder>
            <SupportedByDefault />
            <MappedLocalClaim>http://wso2.org/claims/groups</MappedLocalClaim>
        </Claim>
        <Claim>
            <ClaimURI>roles</ClaimURI>
            <DisplayName>User Roles</DisplayName>
            <AttributeID>roles</AttributeID>
            <Description>List of role names that have been assigned to the principal. This typically will require a mapping at the application container level to application deployment roles.</Description>
            <DisplayOrder>13</DisplayOrder>
            <SupportedByDefault />
            <MappedLocalClaim>http://wso2.org/claims/roles</MappedLocalClaim>
        </Claim>
        ```

## Disabling versioning in the registry configuration
If there are frequently updating registry properties, having the versioning enabled for
registry resources in the registry can lead to unnecessary growth in the registry-related
tables in the database. To avoid this, we have disabled versioning by default from WSO2 Identity
Server 6.0.0 onward.

Therefore, when migrating to WSO2 IS 6.1.0 from a version prior to IS 6.0.0, it is **required** to turn off the registry versioning in your current WSO2 IS and run the below scripts against the database that is used by the registry.

> **Turning off registry versioning in your current WSO2 IS and running the scripts**
>
> Open the `registry.xml` file in the `<OLD_IS_HOME>/repository/conf` directory. Set the `versioningProperties`, `versioningComments`, `versioningTags` and `versioningRatings` false.
>
>   ```
>   <staticConfiguration>
>         <versioningProperties>false</versioningProperties>
>         <versioningComments>false</versioningComments>
>         <versioningTags>false</versioningTags>
>         <versioningRatings>false</versioningRatings>
>   </staticConfiguration>
>   ```
>   
>>  **Warning**
>>
>>  If the above configurations are already set as `false`, you should not run the below scripts.
>    
>  When the above configurations are turned off, we need to remove the versioning details from the database in order for the registry resources to work properly. Select the relevant DB type and run the script against the DB where the registry resides.
>    
>   **DB Scripts**
>
>   The following database scripts are provided by the WSO2 team. 
>
>   | DB type      | Script name |
>   | ----------- | ----------- |
>   | H2      | `1_H2.h2.db`     |
>   | DB2   | `2_DB2.db2`        |
>   | MSSQL | `3_MSSQL.sql` |
>   | MySQL | `4_MySQL.sql` |
>   | Oracle | `5_Oracle.sql` |
>   | PostgreSQL | `6_PostgreSQL.sql` |
