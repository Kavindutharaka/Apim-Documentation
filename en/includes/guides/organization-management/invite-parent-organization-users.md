# Invite users from the parent organization

Customer/Partner organizations may sometimes need help performing administrative tasks from members of the parent organization. Also, members of an organization who are also members of the parent organization might want to bring in more members from the parent organization.

For such scenarios, {{product_name}} organizations can invite parent organization users to join their organizations. When you invite users, you may assign them to specific groups to provide the right level of permissions. Once the users accept the invitations, they will be added to the organization and be assigned to the specified groups.

## Prerequisites

In order to invite users from the parent organization, get to know the usernames of the users through an offline channel.
